# Connect 4 by Aena Teodocio
# A classic strategy game where players battle to own the grid! Players choose "X" or "O" to represent their piece.
# They drop the piece into the grid, starting in the middle or at the edge.
# Use strategy to block opponents while aiming to be the first player to win by getting 4 pieces in a row.
# You win by stacking 4 pieces in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally!
